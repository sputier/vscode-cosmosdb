[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb) [![Release Status](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb.svg?label=prerelease&colorB=0E7FC0)](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/releases)

Browse and query your MongoDB databases both locally and in the cloud using [_scrapbooks_](#mongo-scrapbooks) with rich Intellisense. Connect to Azure and manage your Cosmos DB databases with support for MongoDB, Graph (Gremlin), and DocumentDB.

# Prerequisites

- For Mongo DB support, install [Mongo DB and Mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

# Features

## Cosmos DB Explorer

- Create a Cosmos DB account by clicking the `+` button in the title
- View Azure Cosmos DB accounts and open directly in the portal
- View/Create/Delete databases, collections, graphs, and documents
- Click on a document to open in the editor
- Click on a graph to visualize data
- Query graph using [Gremlin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin-support)
- Edit a document and persist changes to the cloud
- Attach a Mongo server by clicking the plug icon in the title

*Support for Table accounts in CosmosDB is coming soon!

## Mongo "Scrapbooks"

- Configure the user setting `mongo.shell.path` to your mongo shell executable path
- Click on any DB to open the Mongo shell playground editor
- Enter your scripts, eg: `db.<collectionName>.find()`
- IntelliSense (completions) will be provided as you write your scripts
- Select the script and press `CMD+"` (`CTRL+"` on Windows and Linux) to see the results

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.

## Use [Gremlin](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin-support) to query graphs

- <a name="graphSettings"></a>Configure the user setting `cosmosDB.graph.viewSettings` to customize which properties to display and which colors to use based on vertex label.
```javascript
    "cosmosDB.graph.viewSettings": [
        {
            "vertexSettings": [
                {
                    // Default settings for all vertices
                    "displayProperty": [
                        // Display name property if exists, otherwise firstName if it exists, otherwise ID
                        "name",
                        "firstName"
                    ],
                    // Auto-choose color by label
                    "color": "auto",
                    // Show label after display property
                    "showLabel": true
                },
                {
                    // These setting apply to vertices with the label 'person'
                    "appliesToLabel": "person",
                    "color": "blue"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]

## Attach to the Cosmos DB Emulator

* Install and run the [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine
* Right click 'Attached Database Accounts' and select 'Attach Emulator'

## Known Issues

- Azure no longer supports gremlin queries on pre-GA graph accounts. If you see the error "Could not find a valid gremlin endpoint for *graph*", then choose "Open Portal" on the graph node and check the "Gremlin Endpoint" in the Overview tab. If it does not take the form of '...[graph-name].***gremlin***.cosmosdb.azure.com...', then you will need to create a new graph account using the Azure portal or the current version of the extension.
- Graphs are not currently supported with the emulator
